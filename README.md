## Description
My goal is to demystify complex topics, mainly in mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

I like to capture the essence of every concept, as this is the way I can understand them. 

Then I make videos about it. If you have any topics you'd like to suggest, feel free to add them in the comments or drop me a line!
